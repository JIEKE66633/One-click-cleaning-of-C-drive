## üí¨ FAQ

### Do backup files affect system operation?

Backup files are just copies of deleted files, stored in a separate location, and do not affect system operation. If the system is running normally, you can safely delete the backup files.

### Will cleaning affect the system or applications?

This tool is carefully designed to only clean safely deletable files, such as temporary files, caches, and junk files. Under normal circumstances, it will not affect the normal operation of the system or applications.

### Why is simulation mode needed?

Simulation mode allows you to preview files to be deleted without actually deleting them, which is very useful for first-time users and helps you understand how the tool works.
